Bone fractures pose serious treatment challenges due to their complex structure and the 
need for timely and accurate diagnosis. Traditional diagnostic procedures such as X-Rays rely 
on the expertise of radiologists, which sometimes leads to inconsistent interpretations and 
delayed diagnosis. Early detection and classification of bone fractures are important for 
developing an effective treatment plan and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we 
investigate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (YOLOv8, 
InceptionResNetV2, ResNet152V2, and Xception) in detecting and classifying four types of 
bone fractures (pituitary fractures, meningiomas, gliomas, and non-pituitary fractures). The 
model was trained and evaluated using a bone scan dataset; ResNet152V2 achieved the highest 
accuracy of 87%, followed by Xception (76%) and InceptionResNetV2 (76%). The results 
demonstrate the ability of deep neural networks to increase diagnostic accuracy. In our study, 
we selected ResNet152V2 as the best classification model because it showed the best 
performance in correctly identifying bone fractures. YOLOv8, known for its efficiency and 
effectiveness in detecting flying objects, was selected as the detection model. By combining 
these two models (ResNet152V2 for classification and YOLOv8 for detection), we aim to 
increase the overall accuracy of fractures. This combination not only ensures accuracy but also 
improves diagnosis by enabling the classification of various fracture types. While ResNet152V2 
outperforms other models, each model demonstrates advantages and can be optimized for 
clinical use. The studies contribute to clinical practice by highlighting the role of machine 
learning in improving diagnostic outcomes. Future work will focus on improving these models 
and solving integration issues to support clinical decisions and improve patient care. Our goal in 
these areas is to facilitate the integration of AI into healthcare, ultimately empowering physicians 
to provide better patient care.
